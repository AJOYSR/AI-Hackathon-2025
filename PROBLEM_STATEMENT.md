# AI Engineering Hackathon 2025

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The “AI Engineering Hackathon 2025 powered by Brain
Station 23” challenges teams to push the boundaries of
intent-based product search, where engineering excellence
meets real-world AI scalability. Participants will tackle the
complexities of AI-driven search, balancing precision,
performance, and scalability while ensuring a robust and
efficient deployment pipeline.

From fine-tuning embedding models to architecting resilient
search infrastructures, teams will be judged on their ability to
navigate key AI engineering principles. 


## KEY ENGINEERING CHALLANGES

✅ Scalability & Deployment: Architect a system that
maintains low latency under high traffic.

✅ Model Optimization: Fine-tune embeddings and optimize
ranking models for relevance.

✅ Guardrails & Safety: Implement hallucination prevention,
bias mitigation, and ethical AI principles.

✅ Monitoring & Observability: Integrate tracing, logging,
drift detection, and real-time monitoring.

✅ Architectural Decisions: Evaluate RAG vs. agentic
workflows or engineer a novel hybrid solution.

✅ Cost & Latency Optimization: Reduce compute overhead
while improving inference efficiency.

✅ Dataset Engineering: Design robust data pipelines for
fine-tuning, indexing, and retrieval.

✅ Infrastructure & Security: Build scalable, resilient
architectures while implementing API security, rate limiting,
and access controls.

✅ Continuous Improvement:  Implement automated
feedback loops for self-improving search accuracy.
